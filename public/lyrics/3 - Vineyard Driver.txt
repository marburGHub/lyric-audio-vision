# Vineyard Driver

Highway rider, vineyard's pride
Bottles clink as tires glide
White gold flowing in his wake
A metal soundtrack keeps him awake
Yeasts be damned, no bubbles for him
Still white wine filled to the brim

Vineyard Driver! Metal Heart!
Where grapes and riffs tear worlds apart
Vineyard Driver! Taste refined!
The cantina's treasure he's sworn to find

Sabbath screaming through the air
Wind in his face, he doesn't care
Guardian of vintner's craft
Dry white wine in a single draught
Ancient bands fuel his days
Through dusty roads and rustic ways

Vineyard Driver! Metal Heart!
Where grapes and riffs tear worlds apart
Vineyard Driver! Taste refined!
The cantina's treasure he's sworn to find

The yeasts may rise
But he denies
The wines that fizz and foam
Iron, Judas, Saxon, Priest
The soundtrack to his quest
White wine waits at home

Buongustaio on wheels of steel
Metal and wine, his perfect deal
No bubbles burden his chosen path
Just still white wine and aftermath
Of vintage bands and vintage grapes
This is the world that Flavio makes

Vineyard Driver! Metal Heart!
Where grapes and riffs tear worlds apart
Vineyard Driver! Taste refined!
The cantina's treasure he's sworn to find
Vineyard Driver!
